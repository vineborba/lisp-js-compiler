# Super tiny compiler

This repo is meant to be a study case of how a simple compiler should work. It takes a Lisp-like input and produces a JavaScript-like output. It's based on the [Jamie Kyle's](https://jamie.build/) ["The Super Tiny Compiler"](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler), following the [@yairhaimo's](https://twitter.com/yairhaimo) [walkthrough](https://citw.dev/tutorial/create-your-own-compiler).

The focus os this study was to learn how compilers work under the hood, and how to do this using Rust.
